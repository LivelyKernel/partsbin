# partsbin

A repository to collect and share components in lively.next.

## About

This is an homage to the `PartsBin`, as included in various versions of `lively`. Since `lively.next` emphasizes collaborative work via file-based projects, we utilize such a project as well to share reusable parts and cool demos with the whole `lively.next` community!

> You are welcome to contribute to this collection! Please read the section below.
> Have fun! ðŸŽ‰

## Contributing

Contributions can be made via a PR to the `main` branch. Please make sure to:

0. Note, that the whole collection is under MIT license.
1. Add a short description of your addition to the README below.
2. Store the `partsbin` project via `lively.next` (or make the necessary adaptions manually, if you know what you are doing) in order to update all `lively.project` related files.
3. Bump the minor version for additions/fixes. Bump only the patch version for non-breaking/not fixing changes.

> **Warning**
> **Note to Maintainers:** We try to merge PRs that introduce a new part via *one* merge commit.
> Fixes to already merged parts should usually be merged via rebase.
